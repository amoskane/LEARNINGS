// coderByte — getting exposed to a lot of problems
// pramp—match with someone of similar ability and work on problem

// project euler — better than leetcode


// udacity course:
// 1. confirm question
// 2. inputs and outputs (set up test case with true and a false result before, then just uncomment) 
// 3. naive solution (communication), put some poop on the board.
// 4. data structures and bigO
// 5. refactor code


// problem
// (an easily translated problem)

//you have an array with 9 objects.
			[A,B,C,D…I]
 weights 	 5,5,5,4.99

scale([X],[Y])
will return 1 if x>y
0 if x==y
-1 if x<y


you want the least number of times you put items on the scale.


//put each pair on the scale, you'd go 9 times.

put ab on, cd on, ef on, cut down to 4



[5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5]
split array into even item arrays, plus a remainder

[5,5,5,5,4] and [5,5,5,5]



send in [ABC] and [DEF]
if you got == then you know it's in [GHI]
	then you run [GHI]



//anytime you split an input in half youll be working with a log
//square root of n ??




//////////////////////////////////////////
I am a robber and I am robbing these 3 houses.
I can only rob houses that are not next to each other.


500	500	100	2000	70
a 	b 	c 	d 		e


for any number of houses, how would i pick which to rob.


find the max, eliminate hte neightbors, then find the next max


[2000, 500, 500, 100, 70]
what index is 2000?

go back to original








graphs.
2 ways to search your graph:
1) BFS: breadth
2) DFS: depth 



1)am i related to a celeb?  (BFS)
2)when was my oldest recorded relative born. (DFS)




1 9 marbles (it's good to be iterative)
2 house robber problem (power of cumulative) (try to reduce down to 1 decision)
3 barb in her neighborhood (DFS vs. BFS)
4 n_queens  (graphs, )



edges vs nodes
	relationships vs objects
bfs vs dfs
	shortest distance vs  deepest search (does it exist)
backtracking
	saving the best results you ve got so far
x-y grid
	special becasue can rep as a graph and maybe use backtracking
