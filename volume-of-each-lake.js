var heightOfBar = [1,3,2,4,1,3,1,4,5,2,2,1,4,2,2],
	result;

function allWater(heightArray){


//identify the bounds
find highest number
	does it have a pair?
		yes - add to list of indexes



};

console.log(allWater(heightOfBar));















if there are 3 lakes
then there are at least 4 bars with 0 water above them
and the first and last will also be dry.
